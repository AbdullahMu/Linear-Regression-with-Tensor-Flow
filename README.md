# Linear-Regression-with-Tensor-Flow
Second programming assignment in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning in Finance

**Key Concepts**
* Apply basic mathematical concepts used in Supervised Learning.
* Explore linear ML methods for regression and classification, and present financial use cases.
* Examine how a simple Linear Regression can be implemented in TensorFlow, and compare it with how it is done with other Python packages
* Define Neural Networks, describe methods used for their training.
* Use such powerhorses of modern Machine Learning, as the Gradient Descent method, and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
